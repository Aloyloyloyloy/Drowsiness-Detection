# ðŸ’¤ Drowsiness Detection with YOLOv5 and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time drowsiness detection system using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model. The system can classify a person's state as **"awake"** or **"drowsy"** using webcam input. It includes tools for image data collection, model training, and real-time inference.
